1. *Windows 11 has Access Control Lists for protection state definitions.*
   - *True.* Windows 11 uses Access Control Lists (ACLs) to define protection for objects, controlling access permissions at a granular level.

2. *TCB of any OS consists of Kernel code only.*
   - *False.* The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) includes not just the kernel but also any hardware, firmware, and software components that are critical to security, such as authentication mechanisms and secure storage.

3. *Lampson’s access matrix depicts a mandatory protection system.*
   - *False.* Lampson’s access matrix describes a discretionary access control system, where users control access to objects based on their identity and the permissions granted.

4. *MLS in Multics protects the integrity of data segments.*
   - *False.* The Multics system's primary focus in its MLS (Multi-Level Security) model is on confidentiality rather than integrity. The Bell-LaPadula model used in MLS enforces security policies related to confidentiality.

5. *Complete Mediation & Verifiability are the sufficient conditions for enforcing the secure access control (Reference Monitor).*
   - *False.* Complete Mediation and Verifiability are necessary conditions, but they are not sufficient alone. A secure access control system also requires conditions like Tamper-Proofing and Small Trusted Computing Base.

6. *Recent device explosion attacks could be prevented to a certain extent with the help of Verification of the software/hardware.*
   - *True.* Verifying the software and hardware (e.g., using formal methods, code reviews, and vulnerability scanning) can help mitigate attacks caused by malicious or compromised components.

7. *For given Access Matrix (Fig.1) in Windows OS, J’s private key in O1 can be leaked to S2.*
   - *True.* In the matrix, S2 has both read and write access to O1, meaning that J’s private key stored in O1 could be read by S2.

8. *For given Access Matrix (Fig.1) in Multics OS, J’s private key in O1 can be leaked to S2.*
   - *False.* In a Multics environment, leakage would not be allowed due to its strict enforcement of access controls and classification levels. J operates at a secret level, while S2 is unclassified.

9. *In Linux, a non-root user cannot change the access control permission of any file.*
   - *True.* In Linux, only the root user (or users with elevated privileges) can change file permissions using commands like chmod.

10. *In Multics, say a process at "top-secret" level is infected by a Trojan that allows its execution at a higher privilege ring. This Trojan can leak top-secret data to another process at a "secret" level.*
    - *True.* This describes a covert channel or Trojan horse attack, where a Trojan at a higher security level can potentially leak data to lower levels. This violates the no-write-down rule in the Bell-LaPadula model, which is used in Multics.
